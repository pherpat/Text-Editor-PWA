# Text Editor PWA

The purpose of this assignment was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. It will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. 

The application will also function offline.
